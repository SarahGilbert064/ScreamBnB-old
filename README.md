# **ScreamBnB**
Project Initiated: 26-02-2021
Updated: 26-02-2021

## **Project Description**

ScreamBnB is a hotel, motel, and BnB booking sight for those who want to spice up their trip! Are you a fan of history, horror, and true crime? Then you have found your accommodation booking sight, as we only deal with haunted places! This application will give users access to accommodations all throughout the USA and will include the history and personal accounts of those who have braved a night in these spooky places. If available, there will also be information on tours for those who really want to get to know where they are sleeping. Users will create an account upon entering and then have the option to look through our built in database or leave us information on their own spooky stays for other users to check out!
